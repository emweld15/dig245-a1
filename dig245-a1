My name is Emily Weld.  I am a junior Economics major and Digital Studies minor.
I am taking this course because I think the skills we will learn throughout the semester will serve to be valuable after college and in the job world.  Plus it seems fun to be able to code your own website!
I really do not have any experience at all in terms of creating and designing my own content fo the web.
My goals of this course are to enahnce my understanding and applications of code.  I want to be able to "make" things on my own which I think I will have the ability to learn through this class.
I think the clothing website vestique.com is a good example
