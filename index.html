<p>My A1 part!</p>

<p>My name is <strong>Emily Weld</strong>.  I am a junior Economics major and Digital Studies minor.

<p>I am taking this course because I think the skills we will learn throughout the semester will serve to be valuable after college and in the job world.  Plus it seems fun to be able to code your own website!</p>

<p>I really do not have any experience at all in terms of creating and designing my own content for the web.</p>

<p>My goals of this course are to enahnce my understanding and applications of code.  I want to be able to "make" things on my own which I think I will have the ability to learn through this class.</p>

<p>I think the clothing website <a href="https://vestique.com/collections/new" target="_blank"> Vestique</a> is a good example of a cross between cultural work and art work.  I say it is a crossover because it shows <em>trending</em> women's clothes in a format that is really aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.  Not to mention you can see trends in what is most popular because of the specifc clothes that are always sold out.</p>

<p>A second piece of work I find really interesting is both a phone application and website, <a href="https://vsco.co/" target="_blank"> vsco</a>.  This is a great platofrm for users to display their images.  It is differemt from Instagram in that VSCO takes on more of an atrist's portfolio persona whereas Instagram is used for networking and more personal purposes.  I think VSCO is a great example of art works and cultural works as it is a platform that allows artists to crosds between the two ideas. <img src="https://assets.vsco.co/assets/images/vsco-share-image.png" alt="VSCO image" style="width:500px;height:600px> </p>

<p>Lastly,

Select 3 projects (website or web application) you consider to be interesting for artistic, cultural, or other reasons. List each project with its title, a link to it, and two to three sentences describing the project and why it is remarkable.
